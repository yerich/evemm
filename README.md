Eve Market Monitor
==================

Eve Market Monitor is the start of a project to monitor prices on the MMO Even Online. I created it to provide a way to get up-to-date prices on items in the game at various places, however, I got frustrated about the low quality of the data which was coming in, and stopped development after a while. All code is written in Python.

However, there is a fully functioning database, that hooks up into the EVE market firehose service, and it for the most part quite functional at getting live prices for items. Perhaps the code may be useful for someone.
